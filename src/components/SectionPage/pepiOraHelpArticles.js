          Sometimes after a mama has had a pepi, she can feel down and out. It
          may feel like her world has fallen apart and that she is in a big
          black hole.

        <div className='contentStyle'>
          Post natal blues is very common. A new mama can feel down and tearful,
          crying for no apparent reason. This sometimes happens in the first
          week after the pepi is born. She can feel worried as there are a lot
          of changes occurring at this time. This feeling passes after a few
          days. However a mama can become more seriously depressed in the first
          months after a pepi is born. This can occur any time within the first
          year after a pepi is born. It maybe difficult for the mama to sleep,
          relax, or make decisions. She may notice changes in her appetite.
          She may also have thoughts of hurting her baby or that life is not
          worth living. These symptoms are able to be treated. It is really
        important to talk to your nurse or doctor and seek help early.

          In some rare cases, a mama may experience extreme changes in mood and
          thoughts. She may become very out of touch with reality, this is known
          as postnatal psychosis. She may also experience intrusive thoughts, be
          frightened, hear or see things that other people cant. This usually
          begins in the first two weeks after a child is born. As this can
          affect the way she feels about and care for herself and her pepi, it
          is important not to ignore the signs and talk to your midwife, nurse
          or doctor immediately.
